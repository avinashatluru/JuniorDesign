Welcome to the work from team #3202! 

We are working closely with RATL to implement an Attendance Checker and Storage application. We hope to implement the ability to create new attendance rosters, edit the potential attendees on those rosters, store those rosters, and eventually export or visualize the data relating to those rosters.

As of this first semester, however, we are hoping to implement our first artifact of adding an attendee to the database. This means that we have a full-stack application that utilizes React on the frontend, Node.js & Express.js for the backend, and MongoDB for the database (MERN). Adding an attendee will actually add them to the database, though besides this main functionality that is where we stand right now. We are excited to add more features in the future!

To run applictaion, change into the "client" directory and execute the command "npm start" in your terminal.
